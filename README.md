# WowClassic.exe dumps

Collection of my Wow Classic dumps from when I started working on my reverse engineering journey for this game. Blizzard started adding a bunch of protection to their
script functions in later patches, making analysis much more difficult. Hopefully someone finds it useful to use the older binaries for analysis purposes.

And before anyone complains about me not using a better medium to store these, you can fuck right off.
